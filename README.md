# Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java Learning Journey repository! This repository tracks my progress as I learn and explore the Java programming language. Here, I document my understanding of various Java topics and store code examples that I have implemented.

## About
In this repository, you will find a collection of Java files organized by topic. Each topic corresponds to a specific concept or feature of the Java language. By maintaining this repository, I aim to solidify my understanding of Java, keep track of my progress, and showcase my learning journey to others.

## Topics Covered
So far, I have covered the following Java topics:

1. Variables and Data Types
2. Control Statements (if-else, switch-case, loops)
3. Arrays and ArrayLists
4. Methods and Methods Overloading
5. Variable Arguments
6. Recursion
7. OOP Concepts
8. Getters & Setters
9. Constructors
10. Inheritance
11. Method Overriding
12. Dynamic Method Dispatch

Each topic is accompanied by code examples and explanations to reinforce my understanding.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the repository and dive into any topic that interests you. You can browse the folders and examine the code files within each topic. The code examples are named descriptively to reflect the corresponding Java concept.

To run any code file, ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Compile the Java file using the `javac` command, and then execute it using the `java` command.

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

## Contributions
I am open to suggestions, feedback, and contributions from the community. If you spot any errors or have ideas for improvement, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance this repository and make it a valuable resource for Java learners.

## Resources
While I primarily rely on my learning materials and online resources, here are a few noteworthy Java resources I recommend:

- Oracle Java Documentation: [docs.oracle.com/javase](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/)
- Java Tutorials by Oracle: [docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
- "Head First Java" by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates
- "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch
- Online platforms like Codecademy, Udemy, and Coursera offer Java courses.

## Conclusion
Thank you for joining me on my Java learning journey! I hope you find this repository helpful and informative. Remember, learning is a continuous process, and I will keep updating this repository as I progress further in my Java exploration. Happy coding!
